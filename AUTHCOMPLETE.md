# Authorisation Finished

Hi there - if your are seeing this, you have hopefully permitted Lint to access your Pocket items. Lint aims to help you visualise what you've saved off to Pocket - it's easy to just store and forget - lets make it work for you.

With Lint, you'll be able to retrieve items, retag them, delete them, archive and more. Lint is powered by the Pocket API, and is open sourec under the MIT License, so if you fancy adding some new features, come ahead and get involved.

Thanks form giving lint a try.
